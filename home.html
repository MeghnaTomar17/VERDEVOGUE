          <h2>Our Story – The Birth of VerdeVogue</h2>
          <p>
            VerdeVogue began as a passion project sparked by a simple yet powerful question:
            “Can fashion look good, feel good, and do good for the planet?”

            Founded by a group of college students driven by climate awareness and creativity, VerdeVogue was born out of a desire to challenge the fast fashion cycle and give people a better alternative. We saw how quickly trends changed—and how much waste was left behind.

            What started as a sustainability-themed hackathon idea soon evolved into a mission:
            To make sustainable fashion not just a choice, but a lifestyle.

            We merged tech and consciousness—developing smart tools like TrashScan, WasteWatch, and BinSense—to help individuals make informed, impactful fashion choices every day. With VerdeVogue, our goal is to educate, empower, and inspire a new generation of shoppers to walk a little lighter on the earth, while staying stylish.

            This is more than a brand.
            It’s a movement. It’s a mindset. It’s VerdeVogue.
